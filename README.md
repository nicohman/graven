# graven

Currently in alpha. Provides a graphical interface to load and manage [raven](https://git.sr.ht/~nicohman/raven) themes. This is a mirror of the [sr.ht repository](https://git.sr.ht/~nicohman/graven). Please file issues for graven [here](https://todo.sr.ht/~nicohman/raven) and patches [here](https://lists.sr.ht/~nicohman/raven), though I will still accept issues and pull requests on github. *Be warned: graven is in alpha, and might not work properly.*

## Installation

graven will be available on crates.io when 1.0 releases, but not right now. Currently, you can download a binary version built from the latest git version [on my website](https://demenses.net/downloads). You can also just build it yourself:

`git clone https://git.sr.ht/~nicohman/graven && cd graven`

`cargo install --path . --force`

## Usage

graven doesn't provide everything that raven does, and doesn't intend to. You should be doing the majority of theme creation and editing via the command-line tool, but graven is meant mostly for people who don't modify their themes much, or just install them from others. I'll add a more complete dissection of the features when 1.0 releases.
